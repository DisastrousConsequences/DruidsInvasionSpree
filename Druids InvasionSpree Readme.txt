Announcing DruidsInvasionSpree!

DruidsInvasionSpree is a mutator that adds the assortment of kill messages
into Invasion based games. In addition, you may specify Adrenaline Awards
and/or Experience awards for RPG games.

As always, you'll have to add this mutator and add the following to the 
Engine.GameEngine section of the UT2004.ini: 

ServerPackages=DruidsInvasionSpree103

The default configuration will probably work for most server admins,
with UT2004RPG, however if you are not running an rpg server, change
the configuration option in InvasionSpree.ini to 
InvasionAdrenalineGameRules instead of InvasionExperienceGameRules

There are many configuration options in the InvasionSpree.ini that are 
worth exploring.
